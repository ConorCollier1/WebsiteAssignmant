              <h2>Messi</h2>

              <p class="col_detail">
                Lionel Messi, in full Lionel Andrés Messi, also called Leo Messi, (born June 24, 1987, Rosario, Argentina), Argentine-born football (soccer) player who was named Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) world player of the year six times (2009-12, 2015, and 2019).

Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth team of Newell's Old Boys (a Rosario-based top-division football club). Messi's phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began playing for FC Barcelona's under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team, and he quickly graduated through the higher-level teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.


In the 2004-05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga (the country's highest division of football). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball, Messi was a keen pass distributor and could readily thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship, an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona. The next year Messi and Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.

Messi's play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year. In early 2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008-09 season by helping FC Barcelona capture the club's first "treble" (winning three major European club titles in one season): the team won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain's major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. He scored 38 goals in 51 matches during that season, and he bested Ronaldo in the balloting for FIFA World Player of the Year honours by a record margin. During the 2009-10 season Messi scored 34 goals in domestic games as Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. He earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe's leading scorer, and he was named the 2010 world player of the year (the award was renamed the FIFA Ballon d'Or that year).

Messi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles the following season, which helped him capture an unprecedented third consecutive world player of the year award. In March 2012 he netted his 233rd goal for Barcelona, becoming the club's all-time leading scorer in La Liga play when only 24 years old. He finished Barcelona's 2011-12 season (which included another Copa del Rey win) with 73 goals in all competitions, breaking Gerd Müller's 39-year-old record for single-season goals in a major European football league. His landmark season led to his being named the 2012 world player of the year, which made Messi the first player to win the honour four times. His 46 La Liga goals in 2012-13 led the league, and Barcelona captured another domestic top-division championship that season. In 2014 he set the overall Barcelona goal record when he scored his 370th goal as a member of the team. That same year he also broke the career scoring records for play in both the Champions League (with 72 goals) and La Liga (with 253 goals). Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014-15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour. He scored 41 goals across all competitions for Barcelona in 2015-16, and the club won the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey during that season. Messi topped that with 53 goals for Barcelona in 2016-17, leading the team to another Copa del Rey title. In 2017-18 he scored 45 goals, and Barcelona won the La Liga-Copa del Rey double once again. Messi scored 51 goals across all domestic competitions in 2018-19 as Barcelona won another La Liga championship. In December 2019 he won his sixth career Ballon d'Or. In the 2020-21 season, Barcelona claimed the Copa del Rey title, the seventh of Messi's career. He became a free agent in 2021, and financial issues—some of which were the result of La Liga rules—largely prevented him from re-signing with Barcelona. He left the club having set a number of records; notably, he was the leading goal scorer in the league's history (474). Later in 2021 he signed with Paris St.-Germain.


Despite his dual citizenship and professional success in Spain, Messi's ties with his homeland remained strong, and he was a key member of various Argentine national teams from 2005. He played on Argentina's victorious 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship squad, represented the country in the 2006 World Cup, and scored two goals in five matches as Argentina swept to the gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Messi helped Argentina reach the 2010 World Cup quarterfinals, where the team was eliminated by Germany for the second consecutive time in World Cup play. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. Argentina lost that contest 1-0 to Germany, but Messi nevertheless won the Golden Ball award as the tournament's best player. During the 2016 Copa América Centenario tournament, he netted his 55th international goal to break Gabriel Batistuta's Argentine scoring record. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team's third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived "retirement" lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team. At the 2018 World Cup, he helped an overmatched Argentine side reach the knockout stage, where they were eliminated by eventual champion France in their first match. After a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, Messi led Argentina to victory in the tournament two years later, and he received the Golden Ball award.

Off the field, Messi was one of the biggest athletic stars in the world. In addition to earning a football salary that was frequently, with Ronaldo's, one of the two largest athletes' salaries in all professional sports, he was an extremely successful product pitchman, notably for the sportswear company Adidas. In 2013 Messi and his father (who handled his son's finances) were charged with tax fraud and accused of using overseas shell companies to avoid paying €4.2 million in Spanish taxes on endorsement earnings. Despite subsequently paying €5 million to the Spanish state, the pair were nevertheless ordered to stand trial on the charges in 2016. In July of that year, Messi and his father were each given suspended 21-month prison sentences (first-time offenders in Spain are given suspended sentences if the duration is under two years) and were fined €2 million and €1.5 million, respectively.

            <h2>Iniesta</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIbmWdYEV18" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="col_detail">
                Andrés Iniesta, in full Andrés Iniesta Luján, (born May 11, 1984, Fuentealbilla, Spain), Spanish football (soccer) player who helped his country win the Euro title in 2008 and 2012 and the 2010 World Cup; it was the first time a national squad had captured three consecutive major world championships.

                Iniesta was born in a small village in the province of Albacete, Spain. He began playing for Albacete juniors at age 8, and at age 12 he was spotted by leading club scouts while playing in the Brunete Tournament. Iniesta's family had links with Fútbol Club Barcelona, and he enrolled at La Masia, the club's youth academy. He was groomed through Barcelona's various levels, and his ability to control and accurately distribute the ball fitted him ideally for a midfield role, either defending or attacking.
            
                During his third season playing for Barcelona B, Iniesta was introduced into the first team on December 21, 2002, for a La Liga match at Mallorca. He had had his first taste of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League play on October 29, 2002, against Belgium's FC Bruges. It was not until the 2004-05 season, however, that he became a regular player. He subsequently helped Barcelona win nine La Liga championships, six Copas del Rey (2009, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), seven Spanish Super Cups (2005-06, 2009-11, 2013, 2016), four Champions League titles (2006, 2009, 2011, 2015), and three each of the UEFA Super Cup (2009, 2011, 2015) and FIFA Club World Cup (2009, 2011, 2015) trophies. Iniesta ended his spectacular Barcelona career in 2018 when he joined Japan's Vissel Kobe.
                
                In international competition, Iniesta began playing for Spain as a youth, collecting Under-16 and Under-19 UEFA championship medals, and on May 27, 2006, he came on as a substitute against Russia. He was not a prolific marksman—averaging one goal every 10 matches over more than 450 club appearances—but instead preferred to function as the consummate team player, creating scoring opportunities for others. Nevertheless, Iniesta scored the winning goal for Spain in the 2010 FIFA World Cup final against the Netherlands, earning him the Man of the Match title. Iniesta was subsequently voted Man of the Match and Best Player of the Tournament at the 2012 European Championships; Spain became the first country to win two consecutive Euro titles. The accolades continued when Iniesta was named UEFA's Best Player in Europe for 2011-12. Spain's amazing run ended at the 2014 World Cup, where the squad handily lost its first two games and was eliminated from the tournament. After disappointing round-of-16 eliminations for Spain at the 2016 European Championships and the 2018 World Cup, Iniesta retired from international football.

            <h2>Xavi</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yuEt7GzbiU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="col_detail">
                Xavi, byname of Xavier Hernández Creus, (born January 25, 1980, Terrassa, Spain), Spanish football (soccer) player and manager who was widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world in the early 21st century.

                At age 11 Xavi joined the youth squad of FC Barcelona, a first-division football club near his hometown. He advanced through the club's various junior ranks before making his first-team debut in 1998. In his first season with the team, Barcelona won the 1998-99 La Liga—Spain's top football league—championship. Xavi's playing time steadily increased over the following seasons, and he was a key member of the club when it won the 2004-05 La Liga title. Xavi and Barcelona successfully defended the La Liga championship in 2005-06 and captured the Champions League title that season as well. The team bested this accomplishment in 2008-09 as it won the first "treble" (winning three major European club titles in one season) in Barcelona history—taking the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey (Spain's major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. Xavi helped Barcelona to additional La Liga titles in 2010-11 and 2012-13 as well as a Copa del Rey victory in 2011-12. In March 2015 he announced that he was leaving Barcelona for Qatar's Al-Sadd at the end of the 2014-15 season. He finished his storied Barcelona career on a high note as the club won another treble that season. He retired from club play in May 2019 and was named the manager of Al-Sadd soon thereafter. In 2021 he returned to Barcelona to manage his former club.
                Just 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 metres) tall, Xavi made up for his short stature with an unparalleled field vision, superb ball-handling skills, and the ability to make crisp, precise passes. More of a playmaker than a prolific scorer, Xavi led La Liga in assists in both 2008-09 and 2009-10.
                
                In international play, Xavi was the captain of the Spanish under-20 team that won the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1999. Shortly after helping Spain to a silver medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, he was promoted to the Spanish senior team. Xavi played sparingly at the 2002 World Cup and did not get off the bench at the 2004 European Championship (Euro 2004). He was a regular in the Spanish lineup by the time the team played in the 2006 World Cup, but he had his first notable international success at Euro 2008. There he led Spain to its first major international title in 44 years and was named Player of the Tournament after skillfully orchestrating the Spanish offense throughout the event. The team's success continued at the 2010 World Cup, where Xavi helped Spain win the first World Cup championship in the country's history. In 2012 Spain captured another Euro title, which made the team the first national squad to win three consecutive major world championships and led many observers to argue that Xavi's club was the greatest national team in football history. An aging Spanish team could not continue its dominance at the 2014 World Cup, however, where the squad was handily beaten in its first two games and was eliminated from the tournament, and soon afterward Xavi retired from international football.

                <h2>Neymar</h2>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKui6g5I3Xs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p class="col_detail">
                    Neymar, in full Neymar da Silva Santos, Jr., (born February 5, 1992, Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil), Brazilian football (soccer) player who was one of the most prolific scorers in his country's storied football history.

Neymar began playing football as a boy in São Vicente, under the guidance of his father, a former professional footballer who remained a close adviser and mentor throughout his son's career. Having played street and indoor five-a-side football, Neymar joined Portuguesa Santista's youth team in São Vicente, and in 2003 he and his family moved to Santos. There Neymar, who was already an impressive player, joined the youth academy of Santos FC (the same club for which Brazilian football legend Pelé starred over the majority of his domestic career). At age 14 he had a successful trial with Spain's Real Madrid, and Santos had to increase its spending to retain him.

Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the field, with excellent body control, quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first team debut with Santos in 2009. While playing with Santos, he averaged a goal every other match and helped the team win the Libertadores Cup (the most prestigious South American club competition) in 2011. Neymar's many individual honours with Santos included the South American Footballer of the Year title in 2011 and 2012.

In June 2013 Neymar signed a five-year contract with FC Barcelona after a trade with Santos in exchange for €57 million (about $76 million), one of the most expensive soccer transfers in history. Two years later he helped Barcelona capture the "treble" of a La Liga championship, a Copa del Rey title, and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League title. While Neymar was instrumental in Barcelona's success from 2013 to 2017, totaling 105 goals in 186 games with the club across all competitions, he longed to get out of the shadow of teammate Lionel Messi, one of the greatest players in football history. As a result, in August 2017 he engineered a departure to the French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for a then record €222 million ($263 million) transfer fee. In addition to being the new face of PSG, Neymar also became the highest-paid player in the world, with a €45 million ($53 million) annual salary. He appeared in just 30 matches during his first season with PSG, scoring 28 goals for the club before breaking a bone in his right foot.

Internationally, Neymar was considered for the Brazilian side that participated in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, but he was ultimately not included on the squad. Instead, he made his debut for the national team in August 2010, in a friendly match against the U.S., where he scored his first international goal in Brazil's 2-0 win. He scored four goals for Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup, including one in the team's 3-0 victory over Spain in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament's most valuable player as well as the Bronze Boot as its third highest scorer. Neymar starred for Brazil when his home country hosted the 2014 World Cup, scoring four goals in five games before he was knocked out of the competition with a fractured vertebra in the quarterfinals. Without the team's most important player, Brazil lost by a shocking 7-1 margin to eventual-champion Germany in the semifinals. Despite his early exit from the tournament, Neymar won the Bronze Boot. At the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, he led the Brazilian men's side to its first Olympic gold medal, scoring the winning penalty in extra time of the final match against Germany. He scored two goals at the 2018 World Cup but was as well-known for his many theatrical embellishments of fouls during that tournament (Neymar was the most-fouled player in the event) as for his on-field play. Brazil's World Cup appearance ended with a quarterfinal loss to Belgium.

Off field, Neymar experienced legal troubles. In 2012 a Brazilian court ordered him and his father to pay substantial back taxes from 2007 to 2008. An appeal was denied in 2016, and that year a Brazilian court additionally found Neymar guilty of having falsified documents in order to avoid paying taxes on income received in 2011-13. The player and his father were also called into Spanish court after an investment fund that had sponsored him alleged that it had been defrauded during his 2013 transfer to Barcelona.

                <h2>Ronaldo</h2>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUKGsb8CpF8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p class="col_detail">
                    Cristiano Ronaldo, in full Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal), Portuguese football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest players of his generation.

Ronaldo's father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano's name in honour of his father's favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan, who was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano's birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that club's various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting's first team in 2002.

A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.

After a successful season with Sporting that brought the young player to the attention of Europe's biggest football clubs, Ronaldo signed with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003. He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of the best forwards in the game. His finest season with United came in 2007-08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe's leading scorer, with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League title in May 2008, Ronaldo captured Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honours for his stellar 2007-08 season. He also led United to an appearance in the 2009 Champions League final, which they lost to FC Barcelona.

Soon thereafter Ronaldo was sold to Spain's Real Madrid—a club with which he had long been rumoured to want to play—for a then record £80 million (about $131 million) transfer fee. His scoring prowess continued with his new team, and he netted the most goals (40) in La Liga history during the 2010-11 season (his record was broken the following season by his rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona). In 2011-12 Ronaldo helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best 46 goals during the League season. He scored a total of 66 goals in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese national team in 2013 to earn his second world player of the year award (the FIFA World Player of the Year was renamed the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2010). In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a Champions League title, which resulted in Ronaldo capturing another Ballon d'Or award. In 2014-15 he netted 48 goals to lead La Liga in scoring. Ronaldo netted his 324th goal as a member of Real in October 2015 to become the club's all-time leading goal scorer. He scored 35 La Liga goals in 2015-16 and helped Real win its record 11th Champions League title, and in December 2016 he won a fourth career Ballon d'Or for his accomplishments. Ronaldo scored 42 goals for Real across all competitions in 2016-17 and led his team to La Liga and Champions League titles that season, which resulted in a fifth career Ballon d'Or award. In 2017-18 he scored 44 goals in 44 games, and Real won a third straight Champions League title. In July 2018 he reached a four-year contract worth €112 million (about $132 million) with the Italian powerhouse Juventus. He finished his Real career with 311 goals in 292 matches. He scored 28 goals in his first season with Juventus—his lowest domestic goal total since his last season with Manchester United—as the powerhouse club won its eighth straight Italian league title.

On his home soil, after moving through the youth and under-21 ranks, Ronaldo had made his first appearance for Portugal's full national team against Kazakhstan in August 2003 (four days after his debut for United). He was a key player in Portugal's fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup and became the full-time captain of the national team in 2008. In 2012 his stellar play led Portugal to the semifinals of the European Championship, where his team was eliminated by rival Spain in a match that was decided by a penalty kick shoot-out. Ronaldo came into the 2014 World Cup hot off of his second world player of the year win, but his play at the tournament was spotty, and the entire Portugal team struggled during a group-stage elimination. In 2016 he helped Portugal win the European Championship, the country's first major international tournament title, although he only played sparingly in the final because of a knee injury that he had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo played brilliantly at the 2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games as Portugal advanced to the knockout round only to lose its first match of that stage to a strong defensive Uruguay side.

Ronaldo was one of the most well-known sports stars off the field, and numerous studies of athletes' popularity showed that he was the most-beloved athlete in the world during his playing peak. His extreme popularity made Ronaldo one of the highest-paid endorsers in sports history, and in November 2016 he became the third person (after basketball superstars Michael Jordan and LeBron James) to earn a "lifetime" contract from the sportswear company Nike. Moreover, he established his own successful "CR7" brand of products that included shoes, underwear, and fragrances. Ronaldo's immense marketability was at the centre of a legal issue that arose in June 2017. That month prosecutors filed a lawsuit that accused Ronaldo of defrauding the Spanish government of €14.7 million ($16.5 million) by hiding his image-rights income in Spain from 2011 to 2014. He was accused of having underestimated the income he earned from the sale and licensing of his image rights and the accompanying tax obligations, but Ronaldo denied all allegations. However, in June 2018 he accepted a suspended two-year prison sentence and agreed to pay €18.8 million ($21.8 million) to the Spanish government to settle the case.
